### what does "anota a√≠" mean?

This is a informal way to say "take a note" in portuguese, but the "ai" reminds the artificial inteligence used by Google to
get the sound, compare with their huge databank in a way that the sentence makes sense (at least this is the way I imagine it happens).

### font-awesome
